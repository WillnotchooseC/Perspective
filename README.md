# Perspective
Thanks for checking my code!
Import the main.cpp and Rawiv-reader.cpp file into a C++ project. Debugger that, then use cmd go to the corresponding 
path , on the command line input ">projectname heart.rawiv ppmfilename.ppm" then click Enter, the ppm file will be given at the same
path. :)
